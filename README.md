Subject: Request for Early Release Due to Health Issues

Dear [HR Name] and [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I would like to bring to your attention that I submitted my resignation on January 3rd, and during our discussion, my manager verbally assured me that I could be considered for an early release within one month. However, due to my ongoing health issues over the past month, I am finding it increasingly difficult to manage my responsibilities effectively for an extended period.

In light of my situation, I am sincerely requesting an early release to focus on my recovery. To facilitate a smooth transition, I will ensure that all necessary knowledge transfer and required documentation are completed by today. I have made every effort to ensure minimal disruption to the team and the organization during this process.

I kindly request your understanding and support in granting an early release, considering my health concerns and the commitments made during the resignation process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your prompt response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
